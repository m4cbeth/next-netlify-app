# PHP, the horrifying monster
Suddenly, I have a memory. (reverse, chronological order as often those memorise go)
1. a really cool, hot girl nose snort laugh at me asking if she knew php, when she was describing her website. (
    I was humiliated, 
)
2. This at a time where I was building really cool things, and beginning to really go buck wild learning about the document object and queryselectors etc with javascript.
But fucking CSS. I'd battle for 8 hours straight sometimes. Its cryptic language so hard to decypher; then flex box then grid! align conent align items justify self strain brain scanners give up.

I've been afraid of PHP ever since.

But now.

I master it. WITHIN 24 hours!
